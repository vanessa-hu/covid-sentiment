1.	Abstract
This paper investigates the sentiments of the Twitter community from February to April 2020 in the context of the global coronavirus pandemic, increased discussion of China-related topics with the nation as the earliest epicenter of the outbreak, and resulting anti-Chinese sentiments with blame and controversy surrounding China and ethnically Chinese people. Aggregating a dataset of tweets both related and unrelated to coronavirus and China, the findings indicate a link to more negative sentiment surrounding online dialogue regarding COVID-19 and China-related topics, as well as possible links to how sentiment towards COVID-19 or China may have respectively increased and decreased in positive sentiment over the three-months. This research hopes to better illuminate the shifts in our emotions and attitudes during this global crisis.
